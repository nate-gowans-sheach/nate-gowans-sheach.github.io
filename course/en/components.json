The new tenants work nearby, but had to live with family due to a lack of housing provision within the area. In rural communities around the Highlands such as Acharacle, people are increasingly being forced to leave their families, jobs and friends behind in search of a suitable home. This means that when funding is available from schemes such as the Nationwide Foundation's empty homes programme, it allows HSCHT to provide a new affordable home to the area, and generate a huge community benefit.</p><p>The community owned building had many uses since it was built but over recent years had been left empty. Renovation was needed to bring it back into use as affordable housing for the Acharacle community. A key element of the project was to improve energy efficiency and the introduction of a trainee element.</p><p>A minute of agreement and lease was agreed between the Acharacle Community Company and the HSCHT allowing HSCHT to lease the property for up to 21 years. HSCHT pay the Community Company an annual lease fee and are responsible for the repayment of the Nationwide Foundation loan as well as repairs, maintenance and management costs. At the end of the lease period and upon full repayment of the loan the property will be handed back to the Community Company in good habitable condition.<br /><br />A grant of £25k and loan of £35k from the Nationwide Foundation enabled the renovation project to be tendered with local companies with a specification to renovate the property to the bronze energy performance standard. Improving the overall insulation throughout the property was one of the upgrades that was most important to the project.&nbsp;</p><p>The contractor for the project was chosen through a tender process with tendering documents sent to a number of local contractors. S &amp; K MacDonald Homes was chosen as the successful contractor. With help from Highland Council, HSCHT funded a trainee position with this building firm. The young local apprentice has gained a vast experience on this project standing him in good stead to for starting his studies.<br /><br />Contractor Kenneth McDonald said ' We're not a huge firm but taking on an apprentice is entirely positive. It's important because we want to build a local base of skilled trades so that we can tackle jobs on the west coast without bringing people in from hours away. We're training a workforce for the future.'</p><p>Ronnie MacRae, CEO of the Highlands Small Communities Housing Trust explained that \"HSCHT is delighted to see the refurbishment of Druim Garbh complete. The key feature to the success of the project has been the superb co-operation with the community and the wider partnership of those involved. This project has brought together a welcome and innovative funding stream from the Nationwide Foundation and our well established contacts with the Acharacle community, resulting in a desirable home being available at an affordable rent for people in Acharacle.</p>",

Work to restore one of Perth city centre’s important and prominent buildings to its former glory has resulted in a boost for the whole area. Two of the flats&nbsp;and one commercial unit in the High Street&nbsp;building had been unusable for twelve years as a result of dampness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This regeneration project involved bringing the owners of the seven flats and two shops together. Twelve owners on either side of this block were also key to the restorations of the historic close. Perth and Kinross Council's Vacant Property Development Officer, Isobel Butt coordinated the works, with funding from The Perth &amp; Kinross Empty Homes Initiative and Perth City Heritage Fund. Due to the multiple owners involved in this project Isobel also&nbsp;assisted the High Street Owners Association and the professional team to see this very worthwhile project through to completion.</p><p>With determination and skilful co-ordination, everyone pulled together to get the work done. Traditional materials and trades were used and the completed project now sets the standard for the street and the centre of Perth as a whole.</p><p>The charitable trust which owns one of the shops is now about to let it to their first tenant in twelve years which will bring an income stream to be used for local good causes. The other shop will provide a first workshop and retail outlet to a young local jeweller who has recently graduated from Art School. The two previously unoccupied flats have been brought back up to standard for city centre living with increased energy efficiency.</p>",

This doesn’t make sense, and we believe that even though these properties alone cannot solve the housing crisis.&nbsp;Bringing them back into use could make a significant contribution.</p><p>Empty properties also cause a blight on the local community. Apart from the obvious frustration caused by seeing property sitting empty when so many are in need of a home, a visibly empty property can be a real eyesore. This can cause a lack of pride in a person’s local area and could stymie regeneration efforts. For instance, in an area with a mixture of social housing and private homes, a large-scale renovation of social housing could be undermined. Simply by one dilapidated empty property in the middle of a block of flats or a row of houses.</p><p>It is expensive to maintain an empty home, with security costs and energy costs, if the owner wishes to keep it maintained to a reasonable standard. There are also costs such as council tax to be considered.</p>",
