    "body": "<p>Scotland, like the rest of the UK, is currently in the midst of a housing emergency. There are too few available properties relative to the number of people who need housing.</p><p>At the same time, there are tens of thousands of properties just sitting empty. This doesn’t make sense, and we believe that even though these properties alone cannot solve the housing crisis, bringing them back into use could make a significant contribution.</p><p>Empty properties also cause a blight on the local community. Apart from the obvious frustration caused by seeing property sitting empty when so many are in need of a home, a visibly empty property can be a real eyesore. This can cause a lack of pride in a person’s local area and could stymie regeneration efforts. For instance, in an area with a mixture of social housing and private homes, a large-scale renovation of social housing could be undermined simply by one dilapidated empty property in the middle of a block of flats or a row of houses.</p><p>It is expensive to maintain an empty home, with security costs and energy costs, if the owner wishes to keep it maintained to a reasonable standard. There are also costs such as council tax to be considered.</p><p>In Scotland, empty homes are exempt from council tax for the first six months from the date they became empty. They are then eligible for a charge of between 50% and 90% of the full charge for the following six months. After the property has been empty for over a year, the council is able to charge up&nbsp;to 200% of the normal council tax rate, which is obviously a significant amount of money for some owners.</p>",

Some are even brought back into use as holiday homes, which may not be ideal but could still remove the blight of an empty property from the community.</p><p>In the case of owner occupation or letting out, there is no conflict between a resolution for the owner and for the empty property.</p><p>However, in the case of private sale, there is a slight&nbsp;discrepancy. This is because it is possible to sell a house and for it to remain empty. The sale represents a solution for the owner, because they no longer have the problem of an empty home to deal with. However, the property is not back into use until the new owner has occupied (or indeed, let it out).</p><p>Some officers will close the case when the property is sold, because they have done their job in assisting the owner. Others will wait for the property to become occupied before closing the case.</p>",
